- Social Media Links: Include links to GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, Telegram, and WhatsApp. Icons displayed in white; on hover animate to their official brand colors + subtle scale/glow effect. Optional: smooth tooltip labels.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary Color: Black (#000000). Used for headings, text, and strong UI elements. Creates bold contrast and professionalism.
- Background Color: White (#FFFFFF). Provides a clean, timeless canvas. Enhances readability and fits the minimal aesthetic.
- Accent Approach: Maintain black-and-white monotone base. Allow only hover interactions (icons, links, counters) to briefly reveal official brand colors for vibrancy.
- Font: Poppins (sans-serif). Modern, minimalist, and professional. Applied consistently across all text.
- Icons & Animations: Technology and social icons: white by default, brand-color + scale/glow on hover. SVG format preferred for scalability and performance.
- Subtle SVG background animations (waves, nodes, or geometric lines) in light grey/black tones. Animated counters for stats.
- Overall Look & Feel: Strict black & white base design. Minimalist yet bold. Professional and timeless, with subtle interactive highlights that reveal vibrancy only on hover.
